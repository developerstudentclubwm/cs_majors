The Developer Student Club at W&M wanted to focus on bringing computer science skills to other majors through a series of hands-on workshops. The descriptions of each workshop with relevant links follow below. 

### [Workshop 1](https://dsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-william-mary-presents-computer-science-in-the-majors-public-policy-international-relations-and-government/): Public Policy, International Relations, & Government
#### Date: November 24, 2020
#### Educator: Clare Heinbaugh
Have you ever wanted to learn about web scraping? At this workshop geared towards Public Policy, IR, and government majors, we will explain how to use Python tools to extract current keywords describing a news topic.

[Here](https://youtu.be/0747M5iBZR8) is the video recording from the workshop.
You can follow along with the code in the [lesson_1](https://github.com/developerstudentclubwm/cs_majors/tree/main/lesson_1) folder. 

### [Workshop 2](https://dsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-william-mary-presents-computer-science-in-the-majors-sociology-history-and-linguistics/): Computer Science in the Majors: Sociology, History, and Linguistics
#### Date: October 15, 2020
#### Educator: Emilio Luz-Ricca
Computer Science can help facilitate text analysis and make processes much quicker. Come to this workshop to learn basic programming techniques from natural language processing to boost your text analysis skills!

### [Workshop 3](https://dsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-william-mary-presents-computer-science-in-the-majors-physics/): Physics
#### Date: November 5, 2020
#### Educators: Luke Mrini & Archana Radhakrishnan
At this workshop, you will learn how to use Mathematica to model and visualize physical systems. We will also learn to use the popular scientific typesetting system LaTeX to format and display our results.

## Spring 2021

### [Workshop 4](https://dsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-william-mary-presents-data-visualization-gis-and-javascript/): Data Visualization, GIS, and JavaScript
#### Date: February 25, 2021
#### Educator: Arya Ganesan
In this one hour workshop, we will be exploring basic web development. Using the JavaScript library `Leaflet` and calls to the "Where the ISS at?" API, we will produce an interactive map showing the real-time over-earth location of the International Space Station. By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to write basic code in JavaScript and HTML, and how API data can be used to produce a tidy geospatial visualization.

### [Workshop 5](https://dsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-william-mary-presents-machine-learning-for-medical-applications/): Machine Learning for Medical Applications
#### Date: March 18, 2021
#### Educator: Luke Mrini
Using neural networks and deep learning, medical research has begun to show how common processes within medicine can be automated and operationalized. Join us for a brief introduction to neural networks, with an emphasis on the many modular building blocks that make this learning method particularly powerful. Once we've covered the basics, we'll use the python library `Keras` to build our own neural network. Then, we'll train our network on breast cancer data, see how to make predictions on unseen data, and discuss practical considerations for building effective networks.

### [Cypher VI Hackathon Workshop](http://cypher.cs.wm.edu/): Introduction to Natural Language Processing
#### Date: April 9, 2021
#### Educator: Emilio Luz-Ricca & Clare Heinbaugh
Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most exciting areas of computer science, where tools are being developed using machine learning and statistics to make traditionally unapproachable data sources (text data) more accessible! In conjunction with modern web scraping techniques, NLP can be used to quickly parse and analyze the massive amount of text data online. Join Emilio and Clare from W&Mâ€™s Developer Student Club for an introductory tutorial to NLP in python with `spaCy` and `TextBlob` applied to data that we will scrape using the `Beautiful Soup` and `Newspaper3k` libraries. Prior experience with python is preferable, but by no means necessary!
